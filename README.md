# Silverstripe Basic Auth

## How to Use

The `DataObjectExtension` is automatically applied to `SiteTree`

Otherwise just add the extension to any object that you need to have Basic Auth applied to, if the class has the Hierarchy extension then `InheritBasicAuth` becomes an option for all child objects
